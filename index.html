            <h3>What led me to Lambda School:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I'm 47 years old and for the longest time thought that it was to late for me to make a career change into web development. After many Sunday evenings sitting in front of my computer and dreaming of a job that I would love to wake up to, I decided that it's never to late. So I applied to Lambda School.</p>

            <p>I started this journey Oct 21st after maney years of self-taught learning. I found myself going in circles with the self-taught method. Feeling like I was gaining no new knoledge, I decided to take Lambda School pre-course and was accepted into webpt13 cohort.</p>

            <h3>Deep dive into web fundamentals:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The first month, I have learned Semantic HTML, Vanilla CSS, Flex-Box, Pre-Processed CSS (Less), and Responsive Design. We have touched on Git and GitHub, and now feel way more comfortable with version control usage. We learned to use Chrome DevTools, and started on JavaScript basics right before our Thanksgiving break. When we return from break its right back into a JavaScript deep dive. I will keep this post updated to document my journey in Lambda School part time bootcamp.</p>
