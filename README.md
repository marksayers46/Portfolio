  This is the start to my blog for documenting my journey through Lambda School Full Stack Engineering and Computer Science Bootcamp.

   I'm 47 years old and I know now that its not to late to change careers or go back to school and do what makes me HAPPY!!
I finally built the courage to step out of my comfort zone and apply to Lambda School Full Stack Boot Camp. It was challenging
but I completed pre-course and was accepted into the webpt13 cohort. My first night started on Oct 21st . It started out pretty easy but very quickly became challenging. It's been just over 1 month and I made it through the preprocessors section of the course work. We had a one week break for Thanksgiving and when we return we are starting on javascript. Excited but nervous at the same time, I'll keep you posted!!
